 //returns undefined because isCold variable in not passed as argument in the function, due to this the program will enter into the "else" part of condition
 //and in the else part of condition, variable 'freezing' is undefined because it is defined in the 'true' part of 'if' statement

 //following function will also work like the getClothing() call
